# Privacy Policy for Job Tracker

**Last Updated:** 2024-01-13

## 1. Data Collection & Storage
Job Tracker is a **local-first** application.
- **All data** (job applications, settings, user profiles) is stored locally on your device using the browser's IndexedDB technology.
- **No data** is sent to external servers, clouds, or analytics services.

## 2. Data Usage
The extension uses your data solely to:
- Display your tracked jobs.
- Facilitate search and export functionalities.
- Persist your theme preferences.

## 3. Permissions
- **activeTab**: Used only when you open the popup to attempt to read the current page's title and URL for auto-filling the job form.
- **storage**: Used to save your preferences and data locally.
- **Host Permissions**: The extension checks the current URL to determine if it is a known job site for better parsing, but does not transmit this URL.

## 4. Third-Party Services
We use the **SheetJS** library (bundled locally) to generate Excel files when you choose to export your data. No data is sent to SheetJS servers.

## 5. Contact
If you have questions or feedback, please use the feedback form within the extension or contact the developer directly.
